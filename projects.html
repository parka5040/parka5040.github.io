                <h3>PCA Calculator</h3>
                <div class="project-content">
                    <p>This was a PCA calculator that I originally designed in 2019 using Tkinter for both educational purposes to teach students without a strong mathematical background
                        about principal component analysis. I refactored this over the course of ~2 days to take advantage of the much better PyQt6. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I plan on adding some CPython to this in the future to make it able to handle larger files as well as adding the ability to perform K-means on truly unsupervised data. For now, it's a
                        useful teaching tool or a fun toy for smaller datasets (tested it for up to ~10MB CSV files and it does work, albeit with a little lag).

            <div class="project-content">
                <p>This project was originally written in Python in a messy jumble when I was just first starting out as a data analyst. It was a lot more featureless
                    and relied on the Python interpreter. There was a flattener component that I still use today but I rewrote the whole thing in C# to let it run as an
                    executable without having to rely on the Python executable compilers. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>A lightweight version with just the parsing feature is available below written in Javascript. The executable and instructions how to compile it for non-Windows
                    machines is also available. Check it out!
