    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="section" id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I am a professional Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience in developing and maintaining databases, data solutions, and machine learning models. I have experiences ranging from Cloud development to data architecture and administration.</p>
        <p>My professional and personal journey has taken me through a variety of industries and exposed me to a diverse range of technologies and business models. I am adaptable, very eager to learn new things, and passionate about the world of software and data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="professional">
        <h2>Professional</h2>
        <p>My professional experiences are extremely varied from academia to education to transportation to healthcare. From architecting entirely novel data pipelines using experimental technologies in the cutting edge of neuroscience to
            optimizing legacy databases using SQL Server 2013, I've always been adaptable and passionate about transforming organizations through leveraging data. 
        </p>
        <p>What has characterized my professional journey more than anything else has been adaptability. With the ever-changing landscape of data and technology, my beginnings as a graduate student architecting EEG data pipelines in a biology laboratory looks nothing like
            my current world of leveraging Cloud platforms to train LLMs or maintaining petabytes of data across multiple disparate systems. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="independent">
        <h2>Independent</h2>
        <p>While my professional work is largely focused on data, my independent interests are centered around the development of tools to optimize my time as well as learning new concepts through developing projects I just find interesting. 
            My desire to learn more about machine learning started with fine-tuning BERT for use in text classification, for instance. Independent programming projects tend to be a great way for me to learn new concepts that are currently cutting edge
            but may very well end up within an industry process within a year or two of its release.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to this desire for constant learning and growth, I also enjoy the ability to make my personal life easier or enjoy my hobbies a little more by leveraging my knowledge of programming to develop simple yet effective tools in solving problems 
            related to video game modding, maintaining a server for easy entertainment access, or organizing my schedule. I have a <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/DarkZerker/about-me">NexusMods account</a>, where I have patches.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="personal">
        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in professional or independent projects, I enjoy unwinding by reading a good book or article, hopping on Steam for some gaming, or watching something fun with my wife and children. Outside of the technology world, I enjoy learning about medieval history, mathematics, and science. </p>
